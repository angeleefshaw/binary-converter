Binary can be broken into two categories
- Binary Numbers -  expressed as a combination of 1's and 0's
- Binary Data - includes machine code, boolean expressions (true or false), hardware states (on or off), and/or networking and file storage.

## Computers and Binary

- Computers only understand two states of being, on and off.
- Binary comes in specific lengths to allow for proper processing (done via the CPU)

-- _byte_ - 8 bits
-- _word_ - 2 bytes
